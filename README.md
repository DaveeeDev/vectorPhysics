# vectorPhysics
A simple project where you can play around with an object that is controlled by the controller and gravity

## Explanation
Click any mouse button to view the vectors, click again to hide
The red vector is the result of the blue and the green vector, its not a real force, its just helps to understand how the forces combined look
The green vector is gravity pulling down on the object
The blue vector is the force that the cursor acts on the object, the further the object from the cursor, the bigger the force
The black vector is the speed, direction is the direction of the speed, the longer the vector, the higher the speed
